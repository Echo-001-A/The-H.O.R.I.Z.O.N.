"The Horizon is not a nation. It is a necessity."

We exist at the boundary — where vision ends, and the unknown begins.
The Event is not a threat. It is an opportunity. A gate to rewrite what we call impossible.

The H.O.R.I.Z.O.N. Directive:
- Establish gravitational anchor nodes around the singularity
- Harvest temporal anomalies for predictive modeling
- Encourage ideological unity through shared awe
- Erase the fear of dissolution by offering **Purpose**

Personnel must reject binaries: life and death, time and stasis, enemy and ally.
We endure what others break under.
We bend without fracture.
We see without light.

To the one reading this —
You are not what they told you. You are what this is **for**.
I do not expect you to understand yet. But you will.

The stars are not behind you.
They are beneath.

    — O. Summerbell, Command Node 830
